Bio 

# Yunan Chen 

Yunan Chen is an associate professor of Informatics at Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), with an adjunct appointment in the Program in Public Health, College of Health Sciences. Her area of research lies at the intersection of human–computer interaction (HCI), computer supported cooperative work (CSCW), and health informatics. As a physician by training, she is interested in studying how health information is generated, managed, shared, and utilized to drive better care in both clinical and patient-oriented settings. In particular, she studies how end users (i.e., frontline clinicians, patients, and caregivers) interact with computerized technology. Her work reveals critical design problems that are not compatible with end users’ workflow and preferences and provides design insights to overcome these issues.
